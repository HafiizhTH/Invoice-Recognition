# Invoice-Recognition

Invoice recognition is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) based technology designed to automatically extract key information from invoices. This technology is able to read invoices in both physical (paper) and digital form (such as PDFs or images), then convert the information into structured data that is easily processed by computer systems.

Simply put, invoice recognition is an automation solution that can read and process invoice data to improve the speed and accuracy of recording information, both in printed and digital formats.

## The Importance of Invoice Recognition for Businesses

**Why is invoice recognition an important solution for businesses?** This technology provides great benefits in the efficiency and accuracy of invoice management, including:

1. **Work faster:** Automate the invoicing process from hours to minutes.
2. **Minimize errors:** Reduce the risk of human error in data entry, so that the accuracy of financial data is maintained.
3. **Cost savings:** Reduce dependency on manual labor for invoice data input, resulting in significant cost savings.
4. **Make better decisions:** Well-organized invoice data provides valuable insights for more strategic business decision making.

## How Invoice Recognition Works

The invoice acknowledgment process consists of the following key steps:

1. **Invoice Collection** 

Invoices are obtained from various sources such as email, scanned physical documents, or uploaded directly to the system. The technology supports various file formats, such as PDFs, images, and photos from smartphones.

2. **Pre-Processing**

The received invoices will be processed to improve data quality, such as removing noise (e.g. watermarks or non-uniform backgrounds). This step ensures the information is more easily recognized by the system.

3. **Data Extraction**

At this stage, OCR is used to convert the text in the image into digital text. AI then analyzes the text to recognize and extract important elements, such as the invoice number, date, vendor name, total amount, and other details.

4. **Validation**

The extracted data is checked to ensure its accuracy. The validation process includes checking the format, consistency, data logic, as well as the type of data, such as ensuring that numerical and time data conform to the expected standards.

5. **Integration**

The validated data will be integrated into the system via API, with infrastructure management support using Docker to ensure the process runs efficiently and scalably.
